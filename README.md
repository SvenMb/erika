## Use your erika typewriter as keyboard and printer (and mouse)

![System overview](doc/erika_raspberry.jpg)

### Compatible systems

You need a system with uinput (like linux), python3 and a TTL-serial port with CTS (can be done via usb-serial adapter).

I use a raspberry, because of this everything will be tested and prepared to use it this way. 

### Install

see [here](doc/install.md)
